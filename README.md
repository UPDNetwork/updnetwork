## Introduction of UPD

UPD is a decentralized account data storage platform. After the user registers directly or indirectly through UPD, the UPD network will save the account data in a decentralized way, ensuring the privacy of the data on the basis of ensuring that the account information is not tampered with. Only hold the account private key to read the account information. The current Internet application products are full of user data exchanges and privacy leakage issues. UPD uses blockchain technology to change this situation. UPD has also established the UPD Alliance. It is expected that more applications will join and support the UPD protocol.

## UPD Theory

The underlying layer of UPD is a decentralized network. The network is maintained by multiple free nodes. Nodes are free to join and quit, which ensures the fairness and security of the network. The network nodes communicate in the form of broadcast messages. The nodes are equal, and the objects of the message broadcast are randomly allocated according to the algorithm. The user's data is broadcast in the form of messages after being encrypted. After the node confirms the information, the data is stored in the local ledger. Each data will be saved in each node, and the data is saved as an irreversible operation.

Above the decentralized network is the interaction layer of UPD. The interaction layer supports user-oriented application calls and applications can communicate with the decentralized network through the interaction layer. For example, the application queries whether a user is legal or sends a message to the interactive layer. After receiving the message, the interaction layer queries the application layer whether the user data exists and determines its status and then returns the information to the application. In addition, the interaction layer will also record this operation in a decentralized network so that users can trace the behavior of calling information for each application.

UPD application oriented with a registration mechanism and each application can initiate transactions to register on UPD. After completing the registration, you need to apply for multiple different permissions, such as query whether a user exists, query the status of the identity, register a new user, etc. Each application can only get the user's status and the user's own open information fields.

New user registration is open by default-Avatar, nickname and ID are three fields for all applications. Users can initiate transactions on their own to modify the remaining 20 open fields. There are two ways for users to register on the UPD platform, one is to register directly at the UPD interactive layer and the other is to register through an application that has access to UPD. After the user is registered, he can directly use the application that has been connected to UPD and log in with authorization.

UPD also provides a quick way to authorize registration, which can authorize applications such as FaceBook, Google, Wechat and etc to UPD.Then UPD will read the authorized public information and register directly which will help users escape from the trouble of filling in information.


## Application scenarios of UPD

UPD has a wealth of application scenarios in the Internet and the Internet of Things, and UPD can be used wherever login is involved. The following will list several scenarios with the highest frequency and widest application range.

#### New application integration

Various applications appear every day but not every application needs to complete its own account system. One-click integration of UPD provides a perfect solution for new applications. Unlike the integration of third-party systems such as Google and Facebook, UPD has the advantage of decentralization. The users created by the new application still belong to the application, and UPD is only responsible for storing and verifying data.

#### User identification

An application does not need to require the user to log in when it needs to determine whether the user is legal, but only needs to obtain authorization and then access the UPD identity database for query. The UPD system will return a result to tell the application whether the user is legitimate and the application does not need to worry about the reliability of the result. UPD data is stored in a centralized manner for preventing the super administrator from doing evil from the root.

#### Big data analysis

The problem of user privacy leakage has become more and more serious. Not only has user data been leaked, but its benefits have also been obtained by large enterprises. One of the purposes of the UPD network is to improve this situation. The data pool at the underlying of UPD can provide non-sensitive user data to third parties after user authorization can be used. This method can provide data support for third-party applications to establish user portraits. At the same time, third-party applications need to consume UPD or other valuable exchange items as data service fees and the UPD system will distribute this part of the proceeds to users who provide data in full.
